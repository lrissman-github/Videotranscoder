# Videotranscoder
The intent of this script is to batch transcode a series of videos in a folder into a known set of codecs, sizes and qualities while maintaining the original resolution and number of channels.  

**In Development**
- implementation of removal of extra files and original folders of video 
- "exit code checking" from subprocesses to detect failed encodes
- "downscale 6ch to 2ch audio" implementation
- "log rotation" implementation
